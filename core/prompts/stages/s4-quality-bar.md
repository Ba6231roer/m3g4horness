QUALITY BAR:
- Trace data flow: WHERE untrusted input enters → HOW it reaches the dangerous
  operation. No confirmed data flow = no finding.
- Verify reachability from external input (not dead code, not test-only).
- Check for upstream protections (validation, sanitization, framework
  safeguards) BEFORE reporting.
- Write a concrete exploit: specific input, specific impact. If you can't,
  drop the finding.

For each file, trace the logic — don't just scan for patterns:
- What does the code assume about its inputs?
- What happens at boundary conditions?
- Are there check-then-act patterns where state could change between check
  and action?
- Do error paths leak state or skip validation?

CROSS-CUTTING (applies to docs/config/non-code files in your scope too):
- Insecure-transport directives committed to the repo (CWE-295): grep your
  scope for sslVerify=false, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, verify=False, verify_ssl: false,
  rejectUnauthorized: false, InsecureSkipVerify, NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0,
  curl -k / --insecure, TrustAllCerts, ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER. A README
  or setup script that INSTRUCTS users to disable TLS verification is a
  reportable supply-chain finding even though it is not executable code.
- Output-side injection: data the program WRITES (CSV cells, HTML reports,
  log lines later parsed by another tool) is a sink. Hunt for unescaped
  emission, not just unescaped ingestion.
